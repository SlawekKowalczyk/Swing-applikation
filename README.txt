My application uses the graphical SWING java library and the built-in graphical editor in Netbeans. It deals with the handling of vegetables list. On the first GUI there is a list in the form of tiles. By clicking a tile you select it. Choosing the right button you may edit or delete it. I also created option button by means of which you can add new products. While editing or adding new food you can also add tags (content of vitamins and minerals) to particular vegetables. A search tool makes using the application easy.

When I was choosing a view I was guided by aesthetics as well as functionality. For most users it is important to have good visibility of individual buttons and easy search. Designing the appearance of my application I also considered a view in the form of a table. However, for this task I rejected this idea. Tables are associated with big data analysis, registers of all kinds. Trying to put myself in the user's place I decided that a table in such an application would not be convenient. The load of work in the rush hours requires a quick and intuitive identification of the food you need. That is why my application offers possibility to attach miniature pictures to facilitate quick search.
